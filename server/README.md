Created by **RiotKit Collective**.
Project initially created for three purposes: 

- To store static files uploaded for users (libertarian/anarchist portal)
- To store and serve training video files (video archive)
- To store backups and version them. Limit the disk space and permissions to create a shared space for multiple organizations fighting for human-rights, tenants-rights, working-class rights and animals-rights.
