Docker, releases and versioning
===============================

Images are hosted quay.io

The versions are created from tags, when a code is considered stable, then it is tagged and released as stable.
There are also ALPHA and RC (release candidate) versions tagged for testing purposes, often close to the stable release date.

Please see https://semver.org/ for how we version the application.
