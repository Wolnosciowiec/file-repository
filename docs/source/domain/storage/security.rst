Security
========

File can be PUBLIC or PRIVATE, the **public** attribute of input data that is sent together with file means the file will
not be listed by listing endpoint (unless the token is not an administrative token).

Password protection could be used to protect from downloading the file content by not authorized person, and also it will
anonymize the file in public listing if the person who lists the files will not know the password.
