* AntiHotlink feature: Resolved a notice about array to string conversion ($\_SERVER['argv'] or $\_SERVER['argc'] was an array)
* AntiHotlink feature: The value is now unescaped, it makes life so much easier when a unnecessary quotes are applied (eg. in docker container configuration)

v2.0.6
------

* Added link to the general guide
* Increased coverage by covering the UploadSecurityContext
* Security: Files without a password cannot be overwritten if not an administrator
* Fixed type error in snapshot command
